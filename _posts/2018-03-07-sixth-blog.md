    <td>I could have been more careful looking at the booklet as i when i looked at the image of the fuze box and where the lights and wires were meant to go it seemed fine but it didn't work.
I tried changing the equipment and also checking the code but both seemed to be correct in the end i didn't make the lights work.</td>

    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>To improve my learning i need to look closer at the image and ask for help as though independence is good for learning when it is hard and you can't understand you need someone to show you how and then you learn from them. I wish i did that in this lesson as i could potentially complete it</td>
