Second blog- becoming comfortable with the basics of fuze.

Task

We needed to set up the fuze machines and also create a miniature conversation.

What went well

I was much quicker at setting up the fuze box this lesson as before I tried to hard but this time I took it slower and got it right pretty much first time. I also was able to complete the code in quick time with little problems.

What didn't go well

In this lesson whilst I was quicker setting up the fuze i still had to ask some of my peers for directions as I forgot the correct plug to plug into the monitor. Also I finished the convocation but by the end of the lesson I didn't know how to save it and I will probably have to do it again.

How to improve

I can improve by asking more questions in class as it will make my understanding of the task and how to solve the problems I run into whilst coding much easier. Also I will be able to improve the amount of time it takes me which means I can develop and try more challenging activities.
