Third blog - making an animation which makes ' I love aliens ‘

Task: To make progress with fuze and create a moving animation

What went well

I was able to finish the task of making ' i love aliens ‘. I also managed to figure out all the coding and set up my fuze box first time. This is an achievement because last week I had to ask for some help but this week I completed it first time.

What didn't go well

When I was coding I made a few errors as I was rushing to see the finished product. When I tried to run the program with my original coding it worked but it said ' I love' and it didn't say aliens at the end.

How to achieve it 

I could achieve my goals quicker and more easily by not being quicker but actually slower and more careful. This is because i would be able to complete the task with 100% accuracy and not have to go back through my work or coding to find where I had gone wrong and how to fix it.
