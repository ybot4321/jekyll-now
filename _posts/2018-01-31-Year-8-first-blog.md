First blog-learning about fuze

Task

In this lesson we started by looking at the fuze machine and had to figure out how to connect it to our monitors. 

What went well

I did eventually complete the goal of the lesson which was setting up the fuze coding machine and getting onto looking at some coding. I was able to say a phrase and make the monitor display it in different colours and different make it print in different speeds.

What didn't go well

I spent a huge chunk of the lesson trying to set up the fuze box. I started to think of how to do it and I was overthinking the task. All I needed to do was plug the mouse in attach the power source and attach the monitor. This was easy after I thought about it.

How to improve

In the future I could improve by taking a look at the situation and be slower as though being too slow is bad taking your time to get things right so you are able to spend more time later is better. I could also ask my peers as they may have got the hang of it quicker than me.
