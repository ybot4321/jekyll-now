    <td>During my lesson on the first task I had I was quite confused it was to do with numbers and variable of items. This took a while for me to sort out because when I read the instructions I skimmed through them as up to that point I was doing well. This meant I struggled on the question.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will be more careful when reading the instructions as they would tell me what I was doing wrong and would tell me how to do it. To improve I will make sure that I take my time on reading the question carefully and also not rushing ahead as if I was more confident with the coding before that question I would've found it easier.
